# YouTube Trending Videos Analysis

## Motivation
Motivation derived from realizing how life changing uploading videos to YouTube may be.

## What it does
This analysis helps YouTube users who want to get their videos to trending by providing insight to key metrics such as the amount of likes, dislikes, views, and comments in trending videos. As well as the most popular categories trending videos consist of, and the correlation between key metrics.

## What tools were used
Jupyter Notebook was utilized to clean the data, analyze the data, and visualize the data.    

## What I learned
From this project I learned that data cleaning is crucial when analyzing data. Moreover, I learned how to use Python libraries such as Seaborn to visualize data.

## What's next for this analysis
I look forward to expanding this analysis to consider the content of thumbnails, as well as how long the videos took to get to trending and how long they stayed there. I would also like to analyze what time is best to publish a video. 

Feel free to follow me for future progress on this project.
